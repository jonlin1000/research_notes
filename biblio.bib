abstract = "We consider the classical water wave problem described by the Euler equations with a free surface under the influence of gravity over a flat bottom. We construct two-dimensional inviscid periodic traveling waves with vorticity. They are symmetric waves whose profiles are monotone between each crest and trough. We use bifurcation and degree theory to construct a global connected set of such solutions. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

 abstract = {We consider some elliptic pde's with Dirichlet and Neumann data prescribed on some portion of the boundary of the domain and we obtain rigidity results that give a classification of the solution and of the domain. In particular, we find mild conditions under which a partially overdetermined problem is, in fact, globally overdetermined: this enables us to use several classical results in order to classify all the domains that admit a solution of suitable, general, partially overdetermined problems. These results may be seen as solutions of suitable inverse problemsâ€”that is to say, given that an overdetermined system possesses a solution, we find the shape of the admissible domains. Models of this type arise in several areas of mathematical physics and shape optimization.},
