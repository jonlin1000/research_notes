\section{The Basic Equations and a Reduction to the Stream Function}

\section{Examples of Steady Flows in $2$ dimensions}

Various examples of fluid flows may be generated by considering stream functions which are constant on the domain of definition. Because $u = \nabla^\perp \psi$ we may define it in this way. (How do we recover the pressure?)
