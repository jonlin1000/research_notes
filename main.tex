For this discussion we will fix any Riemannian manifold $X$ and vector fields $X$ and $Y$ in $\mathcal{X}(M)$. Given these objects we may define a kind of dual map $\hat{g}: TM \to T^*M$ defined by
\[[\hat{g}(X)](Y) = g(X, Y).\] Without the use of coordinates we can see that $\hat{g}$ is a bijective correspondance. For instance, if $\hat{g}(X) = 0$, ie, the zero linear map, then 
\[0 = \hat{g}(X)(X) = g(X, X)\] which implies that $X \equiv 0$. This means $\hat{g}$ is one to one. To prove surjectivity suppose $\eta \in T^*M$. This means for any smooth vector field $X$ $\eta(X) \in \mathcal{C}^\infty(M)$. We want to find a smooth vector field $Y$ such that $\eta(X) = g(Y, X)$. At least if we look at the pointwise level it is clear we can choose a vector field $Y$. since, pointwise at a point $p$ it amounts to finding $y_p \in T_pM$ where
\[g_p(y, x) = \eta_p(x)\]
and this is always possible due to the finite dimension RRT. The only question is whether $Y$ is in fact smooth. Since smoothness is a local condition it suffices to check this at a point $p$. So locally at a point $p$ we may express the metric $g = (g_{ij})$, $g^{-1} = (g^{ij})$ which are smooth functions and we may express $Y = \sum Y_i \partial_i$. Then for each $1 \leq j \leq n$
\[g(Y, \partial_j) = \sum_i g_{ji}Y_i = f_j \in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M)\] by assumption. But since $g$ is invertible we may express 
\[Y_j = \sum_{i}g^{ji}f_i\]
and now it is clear that $Y$ is smooth as desired.

\begin{remark}
    A similar kind of argument is used to show that we can identify $(0, 1)$ tensor fields with one forms. Indeed, the map from the latter to the former is
    \[\omega \mapsto (X \mapsto \omega(X)).\]

    Like the above case, the injectivity is clear because if $\omega(X) = 0$ for all $X$ then $\omega \equiv 0$ (this is just a matter of linear algebra). The other way is pretty much a matter of definitions as well: since for $\eta \in T^{0,1}M$ defines at each point a linear functional of the tangent space at that point. This one form is automatically smooth just due to how $T^{0,1}M$ specifies that $\eta(X)$ should be smooth for all smooth vector fields $X$.

    When we identify $(1, 0)$ forms with vector fields the most difficult part is when we have a vector field $X$ where $\theta(X)$ is smooth for all smooth one forms $\theta$. Then to conclude that $X$ is smooth the easiest way is to pass to coordinates.
